            <strong>When:</strong> The voting for the day finishes at 7pm, and the candidates answers will be on the site by 8am the following morning. 
            Questions will be answered Monday to Friday, until voting closes on the 12th October.<br><br>

            <strong>Who:</strong> This is the honours project of Meg Howie at Massey University’s School of Design. She hopes to expand the site to facilitate ongoing public engagement at local, regional and national levels of government.<br><br>
