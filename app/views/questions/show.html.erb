      <h3>Nicola Young</h3>
      <div class="statement span4 box">
      <p>My principal place of residence is in the Wellington City Council area.

I am also standing for Lambton Ward Wellington City Council.</p>

<p>This election is all about the future of our city. Wellington needs change and leadership, affordable rates that deliver value, improved infrastructure, a strong regional voice, better relationships with central Government, and an increased focus on quality of life. We need to address the big issues like the high cost of rates, and annoying ones like parking.<p>

<p>Voters have told me our Council needs fresh faces, not incumbents who've been there for decades. I want to contribute my business experience, energy and abilities to restore our capital city's momentum. I'm accessible, connected and keen to get stuck into revitalising Wellington. Please give me the opportunity to serve the city where I was born and raised, so I can help bring back the spark. Support me with your No 1 vote, for Mayor and Lambton Ward.</p>
